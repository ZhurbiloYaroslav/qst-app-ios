You consider that phased reduction of the nicotine dose may ease the discomfort and help you go through this less painfully.

You will constantly want to pick up the cigarette, will worry, think only about it, and that will exhaust you and increase the chance to fail. On the second or third day already you will think only about the next cigarette. It will look like quitting smoking is impossible, you will start worrying, convincing yourself that all is in vain and so on. The smokers that quit abruptly and are already relieved on the second-third day, feel like they are on the right track, and it will get even easier.

The first mistake is that she starts to limit her daily intake up to the point that she only eats fruits. However soon, unable to withstand it, she stops the diet and restarts smoking, complaining that she had big hardships while trying to overcome the nicotine addiction. The second mistake is being preoccupated. Desire to smoke, along with the constant preoccupation that “I will gain weight, no, I have already gained”, weighing themselves every hour and worrying for every 100 grams of extra weight bring the miserable woman into a state, where she is ready to smoke already, and she wishes all was like before, so that she did not go through all this nightmare. The third mistake is using medications that relieve depression (if, certainly, it is not prescribed by your doctor), to suppress the fear of extra weight. The fear to remain a smoker, uncertainty, nervousness, food restrictions, friends’ advice that you will surely get weight do not encourage optimism. Whereas the arguments in the family, intolerance may develop depression in a woman, possibly even harming her health. However, the goal itself will not be reached, as in 90% of cases women remain smokers only because of the incompetent approach to the problem solution. You know why you may gain weight when quitting smoking. You may, but not necessarily you will. Pay attention to that! This is not karma to gain weight when overcoming the nicotine addiction. Confident words of your friends may not be a doctrine, as they rely on their experience, while I bring real examples and cases.
